Walken PvP simulator
====================

Collection of scripts to run simulation of PvP battles.

Actual might diverge from reality.

For bulk operations :
1. Check gen.py to configure cathlete builds to generate.
2. Run task_planner.py once to generate tasks files.
3. Run task_scheduler.py to run computations.

task_scheduler.py can be stopped and resumed later if needed.
